# Day-4 – Elevate Labs  
SQL Developer Internship – Day 4 Task

## Hostel Management System

This task focuses on applying aggregate functions, grouping, and filtering operations to summarize and analyze data from the `hostel`, `room`, and `mess` tables.

### SQL Operations Performed

1. **Apply Aggregate Functions on Numeric Columns**  
   - Used `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` on numeric fields such as hostel capacity, room count, and mess cost.  
   - Applied conditions using `WHERE` clauses to filter results during aggregation.

2. **Use GROUP BY to Categorize**  
   - Categorized data using `GROUP BY`, such as grouping by mess type or hostel type.  
   - Calculated aggregate values like total number of rooms for each hostel type.

3. **Filter Groups Using HAVING**  
   - Used `HAVING` to filter grouped results based on aggregate conditions.  
   - Retrieved mess types with average cost above or within a specific range.
